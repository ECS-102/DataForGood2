User Story A: As a customer of the streaming music service Spotbox, I want to create a smart playlist based on my music preferences so I can learn about more new artists.

The Spotbox class processes and analyzes data about the songs available in its music streaming service. Complete the Spotbox class with:

instance variables to store the data you want to analyze

a constructor to initialize the instance variables

method(s) to analyze the data to find the information needed

Hint: To compare two Strings for equality, you will need to use the equals() method instead of the == operator. For example:

String first = "Hello";
String second = "Hello";

first.equals(second);   // returns true

String third = "Hello";
String fourth = "HELLO";

third.equals(fourth);   // returns false


Possible Extensions: I would like to input a filter constraint.
