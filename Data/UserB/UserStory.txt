User Story B: As an avian veterinary student, I want to identify groups of similar birds so I can study them for my final exams.

The Birds class processes and analyzes data about the birds. Complete the Bird class with:

instance variables to store the data you want to analyze

a constructor to initialize the instance variables

method(s) to analyze the data to find the information needed




Possible Extensions: I would like to be quizzed on descriptors based on the bird.

Dataset: 100 Birds of the World
