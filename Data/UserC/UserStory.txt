User Story C: As a manager of a technology non-profit organization, I want to find the areas that have low internet access so I can focus my team's efforts.

The InternetAccess class processes and analyzes data about Internet access in different countries. Complete the InternetAccess class with:

instance variables to store the data you want to analyze

a constructor to initialize the instance variables

method(s) to analyze the data to find the information needed


Possible Extensions: I would like to consider multiple datasets.

Dataset: Internet Usage and Access Worldwide AND/OR Countries and Territories
