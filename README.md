Project Description
Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.Program Requirements
Use your knowledge of 1D arrays and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
Create a 1D array – Create a 1D array that stores the data that your user needs information about
Implement one or more algorithms – Implement one or more algorithms to find the information your user needs from the data stored in a 1D array
Implement user interaction – Use the Scanner class to obtain user input to select the information the user is looking for about the data
(Optional) Implement user interaction via GUI - Use Swing Library to create graphical elements  to obtain user input to select the information the user is looking for about the data
